# Security Policy

We take user security and privacy seriously. If you discover a vulnerability or security issue, please follow the responsible disclosure process below.

## Supported Versions
- We primarily maintain the `main` branch and the most recent extension release (see version in `static/manifest.json`).
- Older versions may not receive security fixes; please upgrade to the latest release.

## How to Disclose
- Prefer GitHub “Private Vulnerability Report” or “Security Advisories”.
- If those are not available, create a minimal public Issue indicating it is a security problem; maintainers will move the discussion to a private channel.
- Please avoid publishing details publicly until we fix the issue and release an advisory.

## What to Include
- A short description and impact (e.g., data leakage, permission misuse).
- Reproduction steps or a minimal PoC (do not include personal data).
- Affected environment details (browser version, platform, extension version).

## Our Response
- We aim to acknowledge within 7 days and begin remediation; complex issues may take longer.
- After a fix is released, we will publish notes and credit the reporter (if you wish).

## Scope
- This project does not upload recordings to any server; data remains in local OPFS or user-downloaded files.
- If cloud sync or online services are introduced in the future, we will update the privacy policy and security scope accordingly.

Thank you for helping improve the security and reliability of this project!
