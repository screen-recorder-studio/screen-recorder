## Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2023-10-27

Screen Recorder Studio is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines our data handling practices to ensure you have full control over your information.

### 1. Data Processing

*   **Local-First Principle:** All screen recording and video processing tasks are performed locally on your device by default. Your data is not automatically transmitted to any external servers.
*   **No Automatic Data Collection:** We do not automatically collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) or content from your screen recordings.
*   **User-Controlled Publishing:** You have the option to publish your videos to an online platform. This action requires your explicit authorization and is not performed automatically.

### 2. Chrome Permissions

To provide our core functionalities, Studio Capture requires the following Chrome permissions:

*   `desktopCapture`: Essential for capturing your screen, individual application windows, or browser tabs.
*   `downloads`: Allows you to save your recorded videos directly to your local disk.
*   `storage`: Used to save your recording settings and preferences locally.
*   `unlimitedStorage`: Necessary for handling large video files that exceed standard storage limits.
*   `sidePanel`: Enables the extension's user interface to be displayed in the browser's side panel.
*   `activeTab` & `scripting`: Required for the element selection feature, allowing you to record specific parts of a webpage.
*   `tabs`: Used to manage and coordinate recording across different browser tabs.
*   `offscreen`: Ensures stable recording and processing in the background without interrupting your workflow.
*   `host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]`: Needed for the element selection feature to function on any website you visit.

We are committed to using these permissions strictly for their intended purposes and will never misuse them to infringe on your privacy or collect your data.

### 3. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
