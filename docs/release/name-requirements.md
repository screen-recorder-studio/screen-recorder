# Chrome Extension Name Requirements

Based on the official Chrome Web Store guidelines, here are the key requirements for your extension's name:

*   **Character Limit:** The `name` field in your `manifest.json` file has a universal limit of **75 characters**. This applies to all languages.
*   **Uniqueness:** While not a strict technical requirement that will block your submission, having a unique name is highly recommended to avoid user confusion and potential trademark issues.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The name should be easy to understand and accurately represent the extension's purpose. Avoid generic or keyword-stuffed names.
*   **No Spam:** Do not include misleading or spammy content in the name.

Exceeding the 75-character limit will prevent you from uploading your extension to the Chrome Web Store.
